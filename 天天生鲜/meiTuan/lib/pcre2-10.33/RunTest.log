Test 0: Unchecked pcre2test argument tests (to improve coverage)
  OK
Test 1: Main non-UTF, non-UCP functionality (compatible with Perl >= 5.10)

'fr' or 'french' locales can be set, or the "locale" command is
not available to check for them.

  OK
Test 6: DFA matching main non-UTF, non-UCP functionality
  OK
Test 7: DFA matching with UTF-8 and Unicode property support
  OK
Test 8: Internal offsets and code size tests
  OK
Test 9: Specials for the basic 8-bit library
  OK
Test 10: Specials for the 8-bit library with UTF-8 and UCP support

Test 13: DFA specials for the basic 16-bit and 32-bit libraries

  Skipped because JIT is not available or nojit was specified
Test 18: Tests of the POSIX interface, excluding UTF/UCP
  OK
Test 19: Tests of the POSIX interface with UTF/UCP
  OK
Test 20: Serialization and code copy tests
  OK
Test 21: \C tests without UTF (supported for DFA matching)
  OK
  OK with DFA
Test 22: \C tests with UTF (not supported for DFA matching)
